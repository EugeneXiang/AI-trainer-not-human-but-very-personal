# 🧠 AI Trainer Portfolio – Eugene Xiang

> **"I don't train people to use AI. I train AI to understand people."**

Welcome to my digital lab, where prompts are recipes, LoRA is the seasoning, and punctuation monsters occasionally need to be tamed. This is not your average AI portfolio—this is a record of **training the untrainable**, with a personality.

## 🎯 About This Repository
This is the living portfolio of an AI Trainer—not for humans, but for models. I'm Eugene Xiang, a business trainer-turned-model-whisperer who fine-tunes language models to reflect tone, reduce nonsense, and yes, stop them from abusing quotation marks.

I come from a background in corporate consulting, sales enablement, and digital transformation—but these days, you'll find me poking around token distributions, designing prompt experiments, and whispering sweet syntax into GPT's ears.

## 🧭 Philosophy Notes
> "Prompting is persuasion. Fine-tuning is memory surgery."

In this section I’ll drop occasional notes on:
- Prompting vs fine-tuning: when to use which
- What makes a model response feel “authentic”?
- Where does understanding end and mimicry begin?

Stay tuned, this space evolves with every symbol tamed.
